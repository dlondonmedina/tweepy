# To Do
This was built following this series of tutorials: [A Twitter Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=5gUysPm64a4&feature=emb_logo). But there are a number of things that still need to be implemented. 

1. Make forms for editing users, tweeps, etc. look nice. They are not yet styled with Bulma

2. Create a system for followers. This could be implemented with a joining table called followers.

3. Create a system for identifying trends via tags of some sort. Probably just the tags with the highest frequency. 

4. Create a system for suggesting users to follow. I suspect this could be populated first with common connections, so more common connections would yield a higher place on the who to follow list. After that, it could parse users' posts to find common topics.
